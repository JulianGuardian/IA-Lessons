"""Week 9 — ADK's deterministic-pipeline counterpart to the LangGraph routing graph.

SequentialAgent always runs both specialists, in a fixed order — no conditional branching. This is
an honest limitation to see directly: ADK's workflow agents (SequentialAgent/ParallelAgent/LoopAgent)
give you deterministic *order*, but not the conditional routing a LangGraph graph gives you for free.
Run with `adk web` from the `adk/` directory.
