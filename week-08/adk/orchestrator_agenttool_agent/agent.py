"""Week 8 — orchestrator + specialists using ADK's AgentTool (isolated call-and-return).

The coordinator stays in control: each specialist runs in isolation and returns a string, which
the coordinator synthesizes into its own reply. Compare with ../orchestrator_subagents_agent/agent.py,
where control transfers to the child. Run with `adk web` from the `adk/` directory.
